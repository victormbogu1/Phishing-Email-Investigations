# Project Overview: Email Investigation for Social Engineering and Phishing

This project fascinates me due to my previous experience at work. I recall an incident where a colleague accidentally clicked on a phishing link, which halted our activities for the day. This experience highlighted the severe impact phishing emails can have, potentially disrupting a company's productivity and security. Such incidents are unfortunately common in many organizations.

Email investigations are crucial for uncovering and managing the risks posed by social engineering and phishing attacks. Social engineering tricks individuals into revealing confidential information, while phishing uses deceptive emails to steal sensitive data or deploy malware. In this project, I will analyze suspicious email headers, content, and attachments to identify malicious intent. 

This project emphasizes security awareness over tool use, requiring a keen eye to detect fraudulent emails. By scrutinizing sender information, identifying red flags in language or links, and recognizing known phishing signatures, organizations can strengthen their defenses against these threats. The goal is to enhance our ability to spot and prevent potential security breaches effectively.

# Walkthrough:
Email is a primary vector for malware distribution, with thousands of messages exchanged every hour. As a security analyst, it is crucial to safeguard employees and internal networks from harmful content. Research indicates that 2% to 4% of all emails may contain malware, with attachments being a traditional method of spreading threats. In this investigation, I will assess whether emails are safe for release or need to be quarantined due to suspicious content. My report will include a detailed rationale for each decision, and this will be documented and uploaded as previously mentioned.
